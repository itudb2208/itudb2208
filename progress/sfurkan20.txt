[06/11/2022] I initialized the Flask project by writing the database connection script, dynamic blueprint importing and the first template as a sample which is index.html. Rest of the project will be built upon these. I also converted our dataset into an SQLite database, which is located at /instance/db/db.sqlite.
[16/12/2022] I added the front-end to make filtering, and created the blueprints for handling search requests.
[18/12/2022] I added the mechanism for updating database entries for teams, players and coaches.
[19/12/2022] I created pagination for search results page. This improved the efficiency drastically.
[19/12/2022] I fixed the routings of redirects after entry insertion.
[19/12/2022] I prepared our database's entity relationship diagram.
